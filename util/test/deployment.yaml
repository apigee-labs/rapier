title: Deployment Service API
version: "0.1"
description: >
  This service implements the entities that are needed to perform deployments of software. The same service is used to deploy customer software (proxies/bundles/Node.js apps) 
  to the Apigee cloud as well as Apigee infrastructure components (message processors, routers, SSO, Edge management server and so on) to the AWS cloud. In the future,
  this service will support deployment of both customer software and Apigee software to an Apigee-managed Kubernetes cloud.

    description: >
      An environment represents a set of running components accessible at a single domain name or IP address. Depending on the context, an environment might correspond to:
      <ul>
        <li> A set of Apigee Message Processors that handle the same set of customer domain names. (This is similar to the existing Apigee "pod" concept)</li>
        <li> A set of customer proxies deployed to the same Apigee "environment" </li>
        <li> A set of Apigee routers deployed to the same AWS region/AZ </li>
        <li> A Kubernetes cluster or namespace dedicated to a domain name belonging to an Apigee customer or Apigee itself. </li>
      </ul>
      The state of an Environment is controlled by POSTing requests to the URL provided in its requests property
      The Deployment Service stores Environments that are currently (intended to be) running, but also stores Environments that once ran, and Environments that will run in the future.
