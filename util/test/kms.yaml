API products provide the basis for access control in Apigee, since they provide control over the set of API resources that apps are allowed to consume.

Specify an app family name, associate that name with a developer or a company of your organization, and select one or more app IDs to add to the contents of the app family. You can create app families for developer apps or for company apps within your organization.
