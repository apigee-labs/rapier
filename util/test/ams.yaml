  Subscription:
    description: >
      Subscriptions record the usage of an <a href="#APIProduct">APIProduct</a> or <a href="#Bundle">Bundle</a> by a
      subscriber (a <a href="users/#User">User</a> or <a href="users/#Group">Group</a> or <a href="permissions/#Team">Team</a>). 
      <p>Historical Note: The App concept in Apigee Edge (circa 2016) is similar to the Subscription concept,
      to the point where it can be considered a renaming. App was not the best choice of name because the concept 
      being modelled is not an app, it is just a key-protected usage of an APIProduct. Using
      one of these subscriptions per app is only a suggestion—it is not possible to know whether customers use 
      a single subscription for a single app, a single subscription for many apps, or a many subscriptions for one app.

      keys:
        description: >
          Subscriptions may include an arbitrary number of keys. Each key unlocks the same APIProducts with the same quotas and ratePlans,
          so from a functional perspective, the keys are completely interchangeable. Managing multiple keys allows subscribers to
          track the usage of their subscriptions in different contexts. For example, a developer of a client app may wish to use the same subscription 
          in multiple editions of the same application, so all usage counts against the same quota. Using different keys
          allows the developer to track which users are using the iOS version versus the Android version versus the web site, or which users are using
          a new experimental version versus the classic version. This information is available (presumably) to the developer through
          the provider's API portal.git
