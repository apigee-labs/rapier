  Environment:
    description: 'An environment represents a set of running components accessible
      at a single domain name or IP address. Depending on the context, an environment
      might correspond to:

      - A set of Apigee Message Processors that handle the same set of customer domain
      names. (This is similar to the existing Apigee "pod" concept) - A set of customer
      proxies deployed to the same Apigee "environment" - A set of Apigee routers
      deployed to the same AWS region/AZ - A Kubernetes cluster or namespace dedicated
      to a domain name belonging to an Apigee customer or Apigee itself.

      The state of an Environment is controlled by POSTing requests to the URL provided
      in its requests property The Deployment Service stores Environments that are
      currently (intended to be) running, but also stores Environments that once ran,
      and Environments that will run in the future.
