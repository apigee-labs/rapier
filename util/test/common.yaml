  Resource:
    type: object
    properties:
      _id:
        description: >
          The _id property defines which resource's property-value pairs are in the data. On create, if no value for _id is given, _id will be set to the URL of the resource being created.
          It is possible to set a different value on create—this is used to create a resource that contans information about a different resource than itself. _id specifies RDF's 'subject'
          concept. It is similar to the @id property of RDF/JSON. It is permissible, although unusual, to update the value of _id.

      kind:
        description: >
          Specifies the type of the entity. We avoid the word type because it's a global function in some programing languages, and we don't want name collisions. Kind is usually set by the 
          client and then echo'd by the server. In most applications, kind is immutable after create, although some applications may allow change.
